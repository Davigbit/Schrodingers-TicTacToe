# Schrödinger's Tic Tac Toe

Schrödinger's Tic Tac Toe is a game we made for the McGill Physics Hackathon (2024). We used Javascript, CSS and HTML to make it. We decided to make concepts in quantum mechanics like superposition, quantum fluctuations and short-lived virtual particles accessible for non-physicists. We chose to go with a Schrödinger theme since his famous thought experiment contains a cute cat (included in the game)! The game is Tic Tac Toe but with 3 new mechanics inspired by quantum mechanics (pun intended). Every turn, one of the following things happens to the grid: 

1. A particle in superposition appears.
2. Quantum fluctuations cause a rock to appear and block your square.
3. One of the Xs or Os disapear, just like a virtual particle.
4. Nothing happens.

These new mechanics make the classic, and fairly boring, game of tic tac toe much more interesting (and not always a draw). Despite there being some chance, there is a lot of strategy in the game. There are some fun puzzles and positions to analyze!
