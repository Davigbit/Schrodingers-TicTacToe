Website: [Schr√∂ndiger's Tic Tac Toe](https://schrodingers-tic-tac-toe.vercel.app/)

### Project Overview
Schr√∂dinger's Tic-Tac-Toe redefines the classic game by integrating fundamental quantum mechanics principles like superposition and decay. It‚Äôs designed to help players grasp these complex concepts intuitively while enjoying a strategic and engaging gameplay experience. The project offers a unique fusion of education and entertainment, bridging the gap between abstract physics and everyday understanding.

The game is powered by React.js, ensuring a dynamic and responsive user experience. Custom CSS styling brings the quantum theme to life with vibrant colors, pixel-art-inspired fonts, and smooth animations. The game logic, built in JavaScript, handles quantum states and superpositions, ensuring gameplay remains true to quantum mechanics principles.

Adding a whimsical touch, playful Schr√∂dinger's cat gifs appear when either player wins, humorously representing the "alive and dead" paradox. These fun visuals lighten the mood and make the quantum concepts more engaging and memorable for players.

Schr√∂dinger's Tic-Tac-Toe combines science, strategy, and humor to deliver an immersive, thought-provoking, entertaining experience. It‚Äôs a gateway for players to explore quantum mechanics in an approachable, hands-on way.
